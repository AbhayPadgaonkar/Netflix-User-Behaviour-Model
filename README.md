# Netflix-User-Behaviour-Model

Project Update â€“ Netflix User Engagement, Churn Prediction & Segmentation

I recently completed a project focused on analyzing user engagement, predicting churn, and performing customer segmentation for Netflix using machine learning.

Project Objectives:

- User Engagement Analysis: Analyzed patterns in watch time, device preferences, and content consumption to understand engagement trends.
- Churn Prediction: Developed predictive models to identify potential churn based on user activity, payment history, and satisfaction scores.
- Customer Segmentation: Grouped users based on engagement behaviors to support personalized content and retention strategies.

Techniques and Tools Used:

- Feature Selection: Utilized correlation heatmaps to identify and select the most relevant features for the project.
- Resampling: Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset and improve model reliability.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Employed RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for model optimization.
- Model Development: Implemented and evaluated models using Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and Classifier, XGboost Regression and Classifier.
- This project emphasized the importance of data-driven strategies in enhancing user retention and personalization within the streaming sector.
